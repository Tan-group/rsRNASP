# Training_decoy_set for rsRNASP

This archive contains "decoy structures" generated by four RNA predictive models, FARFAR2 [1], RNAComposer [2], SimRNA [3] and 3dRNA v2.0 [4] for 35 single-stranded RNAs.

Each subdirectory contains about 40 decoy structrues and the corresponding native RNA; besides, DI (deformation index) and RMSD (root mean square deviation) were also provided.

Please feel free to contact us if you have any question!
